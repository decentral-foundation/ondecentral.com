Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) - What is it?
</span>
<br/>
If you’re in tech, you’ve heard the gossip - generative AI has entered that chat. In that, being one of the most useful innovations in the tech space, ChatGPT has shifted the modality founders use to find their consumers.

What Is and How Does ChatGPT Work?
</span>
<br/>
Broadly put - ChatGPT is the mothership of search engines. Giving users more freedom by providing one incredibly accurate search result in place of hundreds, the ChatGPT webpage (and its’ soon-to-be app) is a one-stop shop for users. For example, you could use ChatGPT to generate a recipe and a correlating shopping list, caption writing for social media posts, or even create specific marketing content.

What Does This Mean for Startups on Social Media?
</span>
<br/>
ChatGPT shifts the lead generation landscape. 35% of users said they use social media to make purchases, making it one of the most (if not the most) powerful tools for marketing to date. With the introduction of ChatGPT making it faster and easier for consumers to find the products they desire, we may be witnessing the downfall of social media altogether.

Where does that leave Google and other search engines if we no longer need to search?
</span>
<br/>
ChatGPT is requiring Google to evolve. In other words; if you can’t beat em’ - join em’. Google invested nearly $400 million into a ChatGPT competitor, Anthropic. After hundreds claimed ChatGPT is at capacity while reporting error messages such as "chat gpt network error" and "error in body stream chat gpt" Google stuck when the iron was hot. In hopes of integrating this technology into its preexisting engine, Google keeps itself foundational and its users corralled.
