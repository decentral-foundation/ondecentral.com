**_FoundersKit Exclusive: How to spot VCs in conference settings_**
<br><br>

In case you haven’t heard, ETHDenver (/eeth denver/) is part of a series of events, conferences, and networking opportunities for the growing tech and Web3 community. In other words: you wake up at 7am, network all day, attend Michelin star dinners, dance until 2am, and then do it again – for over a week. Along the way, you are guaranteed to make lasting friendships, encounter inspiration, and, most importantly - find a VC for your next project.
<br><br>
Our team was there and has all the information you need going into the festival season.
Consider this your guide to survival and success at festivals like ETHDenver, NFT LA, NFT NYC, and SXSW (South by Southwest).
<br><br>
These conferences are jam-packed with events you might have difficulty finding a spare moment. Preparation is your first step to a better experience. Always prepare for the climate. Many ETHDenver events are far apart, and you will surely be invited to last-minute exclusive events. Our team suggests you bring a backpack, warm jacket, and shoes ready for much use. Have a tap card, QR code, or another way for people to seamlessly access your Telegram, social, LinkedIn, TestFlight app, or demo.
<br><br>
Where to find VCs and how to spot them.
<br><br>
First, pay attention to events. They may be on the conference website (a great spot to find the ETHDenver 2023 dates, ETHDenver 2023 locations, and buy ETHDenver tickets) - but will likely be outside the main conference hall. Most of the events our team attended were spread by word of mouth and by attending outside events. Second, the conference hall was great, but the external conference-related events were where the action was. Third, feel free to get out there and mingle, stay flexible, and foster relations with everyone you meet.
<br><br>
So, how to approach a VC or make conversation with a VC?
<br><br>
VCs often arrive at events incognito. Therefore, if nametags are available, they will likely not have one.
<br><br>
To find a VC:

<ol style="text-align: left;">
    <li>1. Take in the surroundings of the event. You will often find them in casual group settings.</li>
    <li>2. Do not hover.</li>
    <li>3. Spot your opportunity and act.</li>
    <li>4. Start a casual conversation by asking them why they love/feel pulled to the industry.</li>
    <li>5. Share your product, and cater your product description to the ethos of the VC.</li>
    <li>6. Collect their number/telegram/Twitter/email and follow up before bed with a quick and specific, “I collected nearly 24 contacts today, and our conversation about XYZ really stuck out to me - let’s find a time post-conference to chat?”</li>
</ol>
