# How to use Founders Kitâ€™s RSPA feature

![preview of our RSPA feature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80501426/215339816-95bffd63-8a80-4bb5-b2b3-bb6e5fb0a836.png)

First decide if the RSPA is the right type of contract for this deal. Your options are

1. Using a RSPA: a Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement
2. Using a RSA: a Restricted Stock Award

If your company has just started, and is between 0 and 6 months old, then we would recommend using our template RSPA, prepared by Cooley Go. [https://www.notion.so/Template-RSPA-2aab6c181a63418c834f0bdcb313b204](https://www.notion.so/Template-RSPA-2aab6c181a63418c834f0bdcb313b204)

If you wish to use a RSA, we will create a blog post about that feature of ours soon!

## Assumptions

1. You are hiring for a startup that is a Delaware C Corp
2. You have already incorporated and have received your articles of incorporation (also known as a certificate of incorporation) from the Delaware Secretary of State

## Steps

Identify whether the person you are hiring holds a US passport, if so proceed. If not request them to apply for an ITIN number. Then wait a period of 7 weeks before proceeding to Step 2.

Decide on the quantity of shares you plan on offering to your cofounder or teammate.

Fill in their stock values and calculate each field for Price based on your Total Authorized shares number (Questions? [Send us an email](mailto:info@ondecentral.com)!)

Export the [RSPA template](https://www.notion.so/Template-RSPA-2aab6c181a63418c834f0bdcb313b204) as a PDF, then create a signing request between you and the stock recipient

Congrats! You are done with this step, but there is more work involving 83(b)!

## Followup

1. Prepare the 83b Election form. Search for 83b in our docs.
